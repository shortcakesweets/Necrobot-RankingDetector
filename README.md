# Necrobot-RankingDetector
 
### detects pb changes

  This will update manually.

### Information

  - This will update manually ( by me, discord : Shortcake sweets#1326 )

    after warachia2's [NecroRankings](https://warachia2.github.io/NecroRankings/) is updated manually (by wara)

    therefore occasionally you will not see updates for reasons. 

### Rule of Archiving

  - Any changes of NecroRankings will be archived, even if that record is erased for some reason.

  - Names which starts with "ID:xxx" will not be archived.



  - If you do not want your pb archived, DM me on discord and I'll erase the records and prevent archives afterwards.

    previously erased records cannot be retrieved.

  - If you want to add / delete a VOD, DM me on discord with the link.

  - I will not archive private PBs that are not from NecroRankings.
